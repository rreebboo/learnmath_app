# Week 3 Progress Report
**LearnMath: Smart LMS for Early Learners with Adaptive & Gamified Learning**

**Date of Report:** August 25–31, 2025

---

## Summary of Progress

In Week 3, the team successfully added multiplication drills with adaptive difficulty, allowing learners to practice multiplication problems that scale in complexity. Progress tracking was enhanced by introducing simple visual graphs to represent learner performance. UI gamification was improved with sound effects to increase engagement. A basic leaderboard structure was started to prepare for future competitive features.

## Objectives for This Period

● Add multiplication drills with adaptive difficulty  
● Expand progress tracking with graphs  
● Enhance UI with sound effects  
● Begin basic leaderboard development  

---

## Activities Completed

**Multiplication Drills** – Implemented adaptive multiplication problems (Week 3, Day 1–3, Reb Jeryl Mahilum)

**Progress Tracking Graphs** – Added visual representation of learner scores (Week 3, Day 3–4, Mark Vincent Verzosa)

**UI Gamification** – Integrated sound effects for feedback (Week 3, Day 4–5, Arman James De la Peña, Jeralyn De Guzman)

**Leaderboard Structure** – Started basic leaderboard framework (Week 3, Day 6–7, Reb Jeryl Mahilum)

## Current Status: ✅ On Track

**Reasons:**
● Multiplication drills functional with adaptive difficulty  
● Graph-based progress tracking operational  
● UI enhanced with gamification elements  
● Leaderboard framework started  

---

## Problems/Challenges Encountered

**● Challenge 1** – Graph rendering slowed down app performance  
➡ **Solution:** Optimized chart library and reduced data refresh frequency

**● Challenge 2** – Sound effects sometimes overlapped  
➡ **Solution:** Implemented cooldown interval for sound triggers

## Plans for Next Period (Week 4)

● Refine multiplication drills with randomized problem sets  
● Expand leaderboard with ranking logic  
● Add badges/rewards for milestones  
● Start integration of cloud-based progress storage  

---

## Deliverables Submitted

● Multiplication drills module  
● Progress tracking with graphs
